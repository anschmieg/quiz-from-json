      "distractors": [
        "Any competitive equilibrium allocation is automatically equitable across individuals, since convexity guarantees equality of utility levels even without transfers.",

      "correctAnswer": "Zero, because when production functions are homogeneous of degree one, Euler’s theorem implies that total revenue exactly covers factor payments to inputs.",
      "distractors": [
        "Positive, since constant returns generate increasing marginal productivity and allow mark-ups that sustain long-run profits in competitive equilibrium.",

        "They guarantee a unique and globally stable equilibrium under any endowment because indifference curves remain strictly convex everywhere.",
        "They ensure that market excess-demand functions are smooth and continuous, simplifying the computation of Walrasian prices in numerical models.",

      "correctAnswer": "Because individuals exhibit inertia and interpret defaults as implicit recommendations, leading many to accept the preset option even when alternatives exist.",
      "distractors": [
        "Because individuals always evaluate all available options fully and choose the one with the highest expected utility irrespective of framing.",
