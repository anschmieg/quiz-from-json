      "options": [
        "Maximizing real GDP per capita regardless of distributional or environmental externalities, provided the budget remains balanced.",
        "Raising per capita income in a way that internalizes environmental costs and maintains social consent by sharing both opportunities and adjustment burdens broadly across the population.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "topic": "Sustainable growth",
      "explanation": "The course frames sustainability as economic, social, and environmental viability. Enduring growth requires pricing externalities and protecting legitimacy through broadly shared gains and cushioning of losses."

        "Permanent differences in saving rates generate permanently higher growth rates in output per worker.",
        "Differences in steady-state levels stem from saving, population growth, and depreciation, but sustained growth in output per worker reflects differences in effective technology and efficiency rather than capital deepening alone.",
