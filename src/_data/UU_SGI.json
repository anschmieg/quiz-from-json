      "correctAnswer": "When marginal abatement costs are relatively flat and damages are relatively uncertain and convex, so price instruments reduce welfare loss from quantity miscalibration",

        "Tariffs raise prices for consumers and for firms that use imported inputs, lowering real wages and creating misallocation even before foreign retaliation.",

      "correctAnswer": "A policy that permanently raises the net real interest rate by boosting productivity growth, holding preferences fixed",

      "distractors": [
        "Because it helps detect the single most binding constraint—low social returns, low appropriability, or high finance costs—so scarce political and administrative capital is spent where growth returns are highest.",
