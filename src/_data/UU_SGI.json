      "questionText": "In low-capacity settings, why might a simple proxy-means test (PMT) targeting rule underperform for anti-poverty programs?",
      "correctAnswer": "Because noisy proxies and informal incomes yield high exclusion errors; community validation or categorical targeting can improve coverage",
      "distractors": [
        "Because PMT always overestimates poverty in rich regions",
        "Because PMT requires biometric IDs, which are illegal",
        "Because PMT cannot be audited"
